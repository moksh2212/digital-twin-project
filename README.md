# 🏢 Digital Twin for Smart Building (Historical Replay System)

This project builds a **Digital Twin** of a smart building by replaying historical IoT sensor data in real time.  
It reconstructs the building’s evolving state using **machine learning**, allowing analysis of anomalies, sensor health, and environmental behavior patterns.

---

## 🌍 Overview

A **Digital Twin** is a virtual replica of a physical system — in this case, a smart building equipped with temperature, humidity, CO₂, light, and motion sensors.  
This project reads historical sensor data, replays it in chronological order, and continuously updates an internal **representation model** of the building.

The twin uses several ML models to:
- Detect abnormal sensor behavior  
- Assess sensor health  
- Cluster rooms based on environmental patterns  

---

## 🧩 Architecture

### 1️⃣ Representation Model
**File:** `src/representation/building_model.py`

The **Building Representation Model** maintains the **current state of each room** in the twin.  
Every incoming sensor event updates this state, storing:
- Timestamp  
- Latest sensor readings (`temp`, `humidity`, `co2`, `light`, `movement`, etc.)  
- ML model results (`anomaly_flag`, `health_status`, `cluster_label`)  

This model acts as the *core memory* of the digital twin.

---

### 2️⃣ Historical Replay Model
**File:** `src/replay/replay_engine.py`

The **Replay Engine** replays historical data from a processed parquet dataset and feeds each event sequentially to the twin.

**Main steps:**
1. Load and sort dataset by timestamp.  
2. Iterate through events between a start and end date.  
3. For each event:
   - Update the Building model.
   - Run all ML models on live features.
   - Update the room’s digital twin state.

**Example:**
```python
replayer = ReplayEngine("../data/processed/building_replay", speed=1000)
final_state = replayer.run("2019-02-09", "2019-02-10", log_every=1000)
````

* `speed` — controls replay rate (real-time or fast-forward).
* `log_every` — prints periodic logs.
* `final_state` — final building snapshot after replay.

```

**Explanation:**

* Data flows chronologically through the Replay Engine.
* Each ML model produces independent predictions.
* The combined results continuously update the building’s digital state.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

The system integrates three lightweight ML components, each focusing on a specific analytical dimension.

---

### 🔍 1. Anomaly Detection Model

**File:** `src/ml/anomaly.py`
**Goal:** Detect abnormal or unexpected sensor behavior in real time.

**Description:**

* Learns normal operating patterns of sensor data (`temp`, `humidity`, `co2`, `light`, `movement`).
* Flags anomalies that deviate significantly from the learned distribution.
* Output:

  * `1` → Normal behavior
  * `-1` → Anomaly detected

**Tech Stack:**

* Algorithm: *Isolation Forest* (scikit-learn)
* Features: `[temp, humidity, co2, light, movement]`

**Purpose:** Helps identify faulty sensors or unusual environmental conditions (e.g., abnormal CO₂ spikes or temperature drops).

---

### ⚙️ 2. Sensor Health Model

**File:** `src/ml/sensor_health.py`
**Goal:** Predict whether a sensor is operating healthily or showing signs of degradation.

**Description:**

* Evaluates communication and power-related metrics (`voltage`, `rssi`, `snr`).
* Automatically labels training data based on defined thresholds:

  * Low voltage (< 3.5 V) or weak signal → unhealthy.
* Output:

  * `1` → Healthy sensor
  * `0` → Unhealthy sensor

**Tech Stack:**

* Algorithm: *Random Forest Classifier*
* Preprocessing: *StandardScaler* for normalization
* Features: `[voltage, rssi, snr]`

**Purpose:** Monitors sensor hardware reliability — detects sensors with weak signal strength or low battery.

---

### 🏠 3. Room Clustering Model

**File:** `src/ml/room_clustering.py`
**Goal:** Group rooms or sensor readings based on similar environmental patterns.

**Description:**

* Uses unsupervised learning to cluster readings or rooms into environmental behavior groups.
* Output:

  * `cluster_label` ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}
* Two operating modes:

  * **Static:** Clusters based on average per-room conditions.
  * **Dynamic:** Clusters raw live readings directly (used in replay).

**Tech Stack:**

* Algorithm: *K-Means Clustering*
* Preprocessing: *StandardScaler*
* Features: `[temp, humidity, co2, light, movement]`

**Purpose:** Identifies room behavior types such as “occupied and bright” vs. “idle and dark,” enabling contextual analysis of building usage.
